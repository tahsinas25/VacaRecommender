VacaRecommender generates a day-long trip given the city name. 

User Interface:
The user will land on the home page upon visiting the website. Then they will be able to navigate to the search page where they will enter the city they want to visit. The application will generate a plan spanning the whole day. 

Tech Stack:
We used Express/NodeJS in the backend and AI Trip Planner API to generate the trip plan.

Additionally, we used HTML and CSS for the front end.
